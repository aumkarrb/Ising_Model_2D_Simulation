# Ising_Model_2D_Simulation

### Design of a basic 2D Ising Model simulation using digital logic gates and SystemVerilog, focusing on:
1. Creation a finite lattice grid representation
2. Implementing spin interaction logic
3. Developing state transition mechanisms
4. Generating randomized spin flip decisions
5. Calculating total system energy and magnetization

# Objective
- Demonstration of fundamental magnetic interaction principles
- Providing real-time visualization of spin state changes
- Allowing parametric configuration of lattice size and interaction rules
- Enabling performance analysis of statistical mechanics principles 

# Knowledge
Key Implementation Considerations:
- Usage 1-bit or 2-state logic for spin representation (+1/-1)
- Implementation of nearest-neighbor interaction rules
- Creation of pseudo-random number generator for probabilistic spin flips
- Consideration of temperature parameter simulation
- Management synchronous state updates
